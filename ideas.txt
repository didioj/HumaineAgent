1. Fix typo in /receiverejection.

2. If we receive a generic request for offers from the human,
then in receiveMessage sleep for about 2 seconds, and if the other
agent has not responded, make an offer, otherwise undercut their offer.

3. What we're trying to avoid: human scamming the bot by constantly
rejecting until minimum offer is reached. So an option is, maybe
we can make it semi-random as to whether or not we continue to offer
lower price or fix the price at a current point and offer a funny remark.
And maybe if thet reject fixed price, we can try again.
