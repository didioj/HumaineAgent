The agent is based is based on agent-py. You need to install Flask to run it:
* `pip install Flask`

# Run Instructions for Windows
* Run `run_agent001.cmd` in one Command Prompt
* For 2 agents, run `run_agent002.cmd` in a second Command Prompt
* To better manage the print statements when trying to debug the code in Windows Command Prompt
	Right click the top menu -> Properties -> Layout -> Uncheck `Wrap text output on resize` -> 
	Set `Screen Buffer Size` `Width` to `1000`. 

# Run Instructions for Mac/Linux
* Run `run_agent001.sh` in one terminal
* For 2 agents, run `run_agent002.sh` in a second terminal

# Demo
* For the class demo, run `run_mod` and `run_agent002`. 
	The template code is too simple and has a lot of bugs, so we made a 
	another version of our agent (mod) to complete against. The mod will
	be Watson and our agent will be Celia

# Test
B = Buyer	\
W = Watson	\
C = Celia	\
* B: Watson I want 1 cup of milk	
* W: How about if I sell you 1 milk for 0.44 USD
* C: How about if I sell you 1 milk for 0.41 USD
* B: Celia I don't like your offer
* C: How about if I sell you 1 milk for 0.39 USD
* W: 0.44 USD for 1 milk is my best offer. Their products must be of low 
	quality if they're so cheap!
* B: Watson I accept your offer
* W: I'm so glad! This is to confirm that I'll give you 1 milk for 0.44 USD.

# Notes
* You must state the good and the quantity when you make the initial request
* You do not need to specify the agent or price
